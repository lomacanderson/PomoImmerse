To start, press the Start button to start the main 25-minute interval. During this time you can do schoolwork, your taxes, or anything you need to focus on. After the timer is up, a 5-minute timer will start meant for you to relax and take a break from whatever you're working on. After that timer ends, the cycle repeats and you continue working for another 25 minutes. You can pause or reset at any time. The Pomodoro technique is proven to keep you motivated and focused on tasks at a higher efficiency. Say goodbye to fatigue and happy focusing!"
